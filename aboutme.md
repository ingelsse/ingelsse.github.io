I was born in August ’73, became a T1 Diabetic in 1991.

My resting place or current home if you so wish is Borlänge, Dalarna, Sweden where I live together with my wife Lotta and our cat Alfons.
I still have no clue where my life is heading nor what I want to do with my life, I guess my childhood dream of being an astronaut is now somewhat ”minor” however.

My working days consists of cooking and serving breakfast & lunch for our future generations in a public school (Yes, I am a cook) but Im gonna study and hopefully become a Librarian instead.

When Im not working I like to mess around with sleep, computers, roleplaying, Lego.

When I have time to read, I’d most likely read ”Weird Fiction” since Im a big fan of the stories from H.P Lovecraft and Thomas Ligotti.
I also love the works of Charles Bukowski and I guess says something of my personality.

I love music and I’m into a whole bunch of great sounding sounds from artists and bands like Neil Young, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, King Buffalo, Pink Floyd, Skraekoedlan, Vangelis, Jose Gonzáles, Run DMC, bob hund, Megadeth, Dire Straits, Nils Frahm, Harold Budd, Robin Guthrie, Roedelius, Faith No More, Goldfrapp, Sly and the Family Stone, Bohren & der Club of Gore and Supergrass.

I seldom discover newer modern stuff when it comes to music these days  but I do discover stuff all the time so the list above will grow until I die. I guess you should check out my scrobbles over at www.last.fm/ingels to find out what Im listening to or the Blog if you want get any tips I’ll might find on my journey down the musical findings path.
